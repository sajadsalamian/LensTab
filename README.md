### Troubleshooting:

1. You can ask the community and the Lens devs questions by writing on our [Telegram](http://t.me/lensdevs).
2. Ask in public, in the Hackathons channel. Neither devs nor the community will answer via DM.
3. Share what you’re building with others. Building the same thing as another team? Merge teams! Anything goes as long as what you build is amazing.
4. Be kind, respectful and patient. Some days might be slower on responses than others, as we are also on a holiday week.
